# Analyzing Political Ad Spending on Facebook and Instagram in the 2024 Indian Elections
## Overview
During the 2024 Indian elections, Facebook and Instagram were inundated with political ads from major parties such as the BJP and INC. This project explores the amount of money spent on election campaigns across different states and the impact of this spending on the digital landscape.
## Data

## Analysis
### Visualizing Statewise Ad Spending

Highest Ad Spend: Uttar Pradesh leads with the highest ad spend, followed by Maharashtra and Odisha. West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Bihar also report substantial expenditures.

Lowest Ad Spend: Lakshadweep, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and Arunachal Pradesh have the lowest ad spend.

This trend indicates that larger and more populous states typically allocate more budget for ads, reflecting their political importance and larger voter base.

### Visualizing Average Voter Turnout by State

Top States: Lakshadweep leads with nearly 80% voter turnout, followed by Tripura and Assam. Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, and West Bengal also show strong engagement, above 70%.

Lowest Turnout: Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand have the lowest turnouts, around 50-60%.

Smaller states and union territories tend to have higher engagement compared to larger states with more advertising spend.

### Analyzing Top Political Parties by Advertising Expenditure

Top Spender: BJP leads with 42.3% of total ad spend, followed by Ama Chinha Sankha Chinha at 24.5% and Indian National Congress at 23.7%.

Lower Spend: Ellorum Nammudan and BJP Odisha have lower spends at 5.19% and 4.27%, respectively.

This highlights BJP's dominance in ad spending on Facebook and Instagram, investing nearly half of the total budget.

### Visualizing Relationship Between Ad Spend and Voter Turnout by Constituency

Higher ad spending does not directly correlate with higher voter turnout. Turnout remains clustered between 60% and 80% across constituencies, despite ad spends ranging from 0 to 150 million INR.

This implies that factors like candidate appeal, campaign effectiveness, voter demographics, and historical voting patterns likely play a more significant role in determining voter turnout.

### Analyzing Distribution of Ad Spend
![distribution of ad spend](https://github.com/sravaniponakalapalli/images/blob/main/Ad%205.png?raw=true)

The histogram shows most constituencies cluster around ad spends of 50M to 100M INR, with fewer spending below 10M INR or above 150M INR. This indicates a concentration of ad spend within a specific range, with some notable exceptions of significantly higher expenditures.

### Analyzing Ad Spend and Voter Turnout by Election Phase

There is no clear trend between ad spend and voter turnout. Phases 1 and 4 have the highest ad spends, with phase 4 peaking at around 70% turnout, while phase 1 has a lower turnout of 67%. Conversely, phases with moderate ad spend, like 2 and 6, show lower voter turnout, and phase 5 has a notably low turnout despite moderate spending.

## Conclusion
The comprehensive analysis of ad spending and voter turnout across various constituencies indicates that higher advertising expenditure does not necessarily lead to increased voter participation. Despite significant investments, particularly by major parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the correlation between ad spend and voter turnout remains ambiguous. This suggests that while advertising is an essential tool for political campaigns, it is not the sole driver of voter engagement.

## Key Insights
No Clear Correlation:
Higher ad spending does not consistently result in higher voter turnout, highlighting that voter behavior is influenced by more complex and multifaceted factors than just exposure to political advertisements.

Role of Larger States:
Larger and more prominent states tend to allocate more resources to advertising. However, this increased spending does not uniformly translate to higher voter turnout, suggesting that regional characteristics and local issues may play more significant roles in driving voter engagement.

Effectiveness of Ad Spend:
The substantial advertising budgets of political parties like the BJP do not necessarily equate to effective voter mobilization. This raises questions about the efficiency and impact of large-scale ad campaigns on voter behavior.

Beyond Advertising:
To truly enhance voter turnout, political campaigns need to adopt a more holistic approach that goes beyond advertising. Engaging with voters through grassroots initiatives, addressing local issues, and fostering genuine community connections are critical components that could more effectively increase voter participation.
